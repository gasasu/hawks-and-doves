This is part of an educational research into the effects of climate and human induced changes on aboreal habitats conducted by Gabriel Sasu

This project utilized OOP to model various aboreal habitats and the species that inhabit them. We varied many living conditions: food supply, water supply, territory, population, introduced new species, and removed some pre-existing species.

We studied how these changes affected the habitats and what we could expect to see in the long run.

Feel free to read, inspect, and fork portions/all of the code.

If you are interested in the results of my research, shoot me an email and I would share them with you.

Thanks for reading
